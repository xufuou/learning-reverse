This is my personal repository contaning material to learn more about reverse engineering.

This is a ongoing process which I will add new content as I start to learn more concepts acompanied by examples.

## Gera's Insecure Programming

This is a set of vulnerable C code that can be found [here](https://github.com/deadbits/InsecureProgramming). You may also find a lot of tutorials discussing its resolution.

Each exercise is accompanied with the original code and a README discussing about its resolution.

## Wiki

I have also compiled a set of background knowledge and documentation necessary to get started. [Link](https://github.com/xufuou/learning-reverse/wiki)
